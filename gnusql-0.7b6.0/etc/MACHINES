This is a list of the status of GNU SQL Server on various machines and systems.

For each system and machine, we give the configuration name you can
pass to the `configure' script to prepare to build GSS for that
system/machine.

The `configure' script uses the configuration name to decide which
known feature it should use. Right now it is required for debugging
tools only. 

If you add support for a new configuration, add a section to this
file, and then edit the `configure' (and configure.in as well) script
to tell it which configuration name(s) should select your new machine
description and system description files.


Here are the configurations gss is intended to work with, with the
corresponding configuration names.  You can postpend version numbers
to operating system names (e.g. sunos4.1) or architecture names (e.g.
hppa1.1).  If you leave out the version number, the `configure' script
will configure gss for the latest version it knows about.


Early beta test:
Sun Solaris 2.x    (sparc-sun-solaris2.*)
i586 Linux  1.2.13 (ix86-*-linux*) 
HP/700 HP_UX 9.0   (hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.07)
