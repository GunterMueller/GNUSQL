If you think you may have found a bug in GNU SQL Server, please
read the Bugs section of the GSS manual for advice on
(1) how to tell when to report a bug, and
(2) how to write a useful bug report and what information
it needs to have.

There are two ways to read the Bugs section.

(1) With Info.  Start Emacs, do C-h i to enter Info,
then m GSS RET to get to the GSS manual, then m Bugs RET
to get to the section on bugs.  Or use standalone Info in
a like manner.  (Standalone Info is part of the Texinfo distribution)

(2) By hand.  Do
    cat etc/gss* | more "+/^File: gss,  Node: Bugs,"
