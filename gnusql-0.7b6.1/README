This directory tree holds version 0.7b6.1 of GNU SQL Server. This
is the beta *test* of the system.

You may encounter bugs in this release.  If you do, please report
them; your bug reports are valuable contributions to the FSF, since
they allow us to notice and fix problems on machines we don't have, or
in code we don't use often.  See the file BUGS for more information on
how to report bugs.

The file INSTALL in this directory says how to bring up GSS
on Unix, once you have loaded the entire subtree of this directory.
The tail of INSTALL contains instructions for USING the server.

The file PROBLEMS contains information on common problems that
occur in building, installing and running GSS.

Reports of bugs in GSS should be sent to bug-gnu-sql@gnu.org 
You can also see the GSS news at http://www.ispras.ru/~gsql.

The file `configure' is a shell script to enable GNU SQL server 
to discover the oddities of your processor and operating system.  
It creates the file `Makefile' (a script for the `make' program), 
which automates the process of building and installing GSS.  
See INSTALL for more detailed information.

The file `configure.in' is the input used by the autoconf program to
construct the `configure' script.  Since GSS has configuration
requirements that autoconf can't meet, `configure.in' uses an unholy
marriage of custom-baked configuration code and autoconf macros; it
may be wise to avoid rebuilding `configure' from `configure.in' when
possible.

The file `Makefile.in' is a template used by `configure' to create
`Makefile'.

The file `make-dist' is a shell script to build a distribution tar
file from the current GSS tree, containing only those files
appropriate for distribution.  If you make extensive changes to GSS,
this script will help you distribute your version to others.

There are several subdirectories:

`src'  holds the C code for GSS (the SQL compiler, run-time library,
       and code of server processes).
`test' holds the our set of tests. it can also helps as am example of how to
       use system.
`etc'  holds a set of useful scripts, required by the compilation and testing
       process, and it also contains GSS documentation.
